## Hi, I'm Alexander! 

#### [A very motivated student on his way to becoming an impressive future programmer] 

I am 29 years old and come from El Salvador, Central America. My mother tongue is Spanish and I also speak English and a little bit of Flemish. I moved to Belgium on 2021 and I am really happy to start a programming career here.

#### Some facts about me: 

:airplane: Traveling is one of my favorite things in life

:musical_keyboard: I am passionate about playing piano

:running: Fitness life and healthy food are topics I am interested in

:bow: I am an introverted person, but not an antisocial one at all!


#### And finally, one phrase that describes me: 
> #### _"I am someone who likes trying and trying until a goal is accomplished"_
